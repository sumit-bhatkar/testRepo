To append to dataframe
	Assuming that your dataframe is indexed in order you can:

	First check to see what the next index value is to create a new row:

	myindex = df.shape[0]+1 
	Then use 'at' to write to each desired column

	df.at[myindex,'A']=val1
	df.at[myindex,'B']=val2
	df.at[myindex,'C']=val3
